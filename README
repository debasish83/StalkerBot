StalkerBot: Reveal how a HN user feels based on their comments.
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can run StalkerBot server two ways:

1) Local StalkerBot simple server (prefered mode for debugging):

> cd src
> python StalkerBot.py

To access StalkerBot web page locally (under OSX) use the following URL:

http://localhost:8000/stalkerbot.html

Log output will be written to StalkerBot/StalkerBot.log file.


2) Apache StalkerBot server (production server):

* Clone the StalkerBot repository into the Apache htdocs directory.
* Edit httpd.conf to point DocumentRoot to StalkerBot/static directory.
* Edit httpd.conf so ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ points to StalkerBot/cgi.

Make sure you change all the configuration lines relating to DocumentRoot and cgi.

Log output will be written to /tmp/StalkerBot.log
